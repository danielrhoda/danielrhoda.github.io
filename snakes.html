									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/snake_skulls.jpg" alt="" /></span>Snakes are famous for their 'unhinged' jaws, which gives them the ability to swallow prey much larger than they are, but this isn't the only function of their cranial kinesis. Snakes must detect, capture, restrain, and manipulate their sometimes living & fighting prey in their mouths, exclusively using their heads. You try eating a sandwhich without hands. Not easy!! To forage successfully, separate parts (i.e., "modules") of the hyperkinetic snake skull perform different functions. For example, most snakes ingest prey via the 'pterygoid walk', where teeth on the pterygoid & palatine bones at the medial roof of the mouth grasp onto prey holding it stationary relative to the ground while the braincase advances over it. The extreme amount of kinesis in the snake skull is one of the key evolutionary innovations that allowed snakes to diversify into the nearly 4,000 extant species we see today. This, and considering it's functional modularity, make the snake skull an exceptional model system to investigate the relationship between functional adaptation and evolutionary constraints./p>
										
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/local_superimpositions.jpg" alt="" /></span>We (Marion Segall and I) wanted to use 3D geometric morphometric methods to analyze shape variation in the snake skull, but conventional geometric morphometric techniques require a single rigid struture, and typically can't accomodate multiple structures (like the bones that compose snake jaws). To overcome this, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/danielrhoda/matched_local_superimpositions" target="_blank">R script</a> that allows any number of biological structures to be considered simultaneously during geometric morphometric analysis. Specifically, this technique, "matched local superimpostions", performs Procrustes superimpositions locally on each structure, and then places these superimposed coordinates onto a reference specimen which defines the spatial relationships between the structures. This procedure facilitates biological visualization and interpretation of shape variation of complex articulating structures, and may be one of our only ways to perform whole-body phenomic analysis! <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab031" target="_blank">This simulation study</a> goes into much more detail if you're interested.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/snake_modularity.jpg" alt="" /></span>Using matched local superimpositons, we were able to find that there are four distinct subunits (i.e., "modules") that evolve semi-independently from one another. This may, in part, explain the enormous amount of diversity in skull form we see in snakes: the more that separate parts of the jaw are free to vary independently from one another, the more possible combinations of forms of the separate parts, and therefore more diversity in form. On the other hand, separate parts of the jaw that are functionally related might need to be integrated (evolve together) to maintain their functional integrity (they need to fit together to function properly). Accordingly, we found that the four different modules are each composed of bones that perform a common function. So, in the jaws of snakes, the pattern of 'evolutionary modularity' seems to have settled on a solution that satisfies biomechanical demands and facilitates diversification.</p>

									<p>Now knowing that there are interesting patterns of evolutionary modularity in the jaws of snakes, I'm writing my dissertation about variation in the structure of modularity within species, and then asking how these patterns are constraining or facilitating adaptive morphological evolution. Stay tuned!</p>
