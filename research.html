									<h3 class="major">Research</h3>
									<p>I'm an evolutionary biologist interested in developing and applying quantitative methods to better understand the processes underlying the extraordinary diversity of life. Specifically, I'm interested in 1) understanding why certain traits evolve over and over and others don't at all, and 2) developing ways to more accurately quantify and analyze the form of biological structures.</p>

									<p>I began my academic research at Indiana University when I joined David Polly's lab as a Freshman in the spring of 2017. In the Polly lab, under the guidance of Spencer Hellert and David Polly, I learned numerous quantitative methods and research best-practices which I now use daily.</p>

									<p>I worked closely with Drs. Hellert & Polly on projects using phylogenetic comparative methods and geometric morphometrics to understand how patterns of evolutionary modularity in limbs shifted during the origin of powered-flight in dinosaurs, and how sexual dimorphism and phenotypic plasticity underlie trait correlations in the heads of dung beetles. Working on these projects under their guidance and learning to code in Mathematica (for which there aren't extensive libraries for geometric morphometrics or phylogenetics) gave me a deep understanding of geometric morphometric methods and an exceptional foundation to begin performing my own independent research.</p>

									<p>Prior to entering my final year at Indiana Unversity I began micro-CT scanning Late Ordovician brachiopods from the Cincinnati Arch and quantifying form-function relationships, which you can read more about <a href="brachiopods.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Dr. Marion Segall at the American Museum of Natural History for a summer on a project focusing on the jaws of aquatic-foraging snakes. Because the jaws of snakes are highly kinetic, we can't apply conventional geometric morphometric techniques, so I wrote an R script that automatically removes any non-shape variation in the system. This enabled Marion and I to - for the first time - investigate shape variation of different bones in the jaws of snakes simultaneously. This project blossomed into two publications and I will continue my research on snake jaws for my dissertation, which you can read about <a href="snakes.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
									
									<p>I graduated from IU in 2020 and entered the University of Chicago's Committee on Evolutionary Biology to begin working towards a PhD. At UChicago, under the guidance of Ken Angielczyk (and others!), in addition to dissertation-related research into snake jaws, I've been analyzing an enormous previously-published dataset of morphometric data of ruminant skulls. I've found strong evidence that morphological diversification of the ruminant skull proceeded along an 'evolutionary line of least resistance' defined by a clade-wide allometric constraint, and along the way I've been developing some cool data visualization techniques which I will hopefully publish soon - keep an eye out for a morphometrics R package!
